    "While generating the `product_prices_renamed.csv` file the following processing errors occurred and they need to be found:\n",
    "1. In the **date** column, data from 1888 appeared - '1888-0',\n",
    "2. Check the **date** column for similar errors but with future values.\n",
    "3. In the **value** column, too high value was introduced – find it and locate the row where it is (use `query`),\n",

    "1. Do the following:\n",
    "a) use `describe()`, to view percentiles,\n",
    "b) use `loc` or `query` to find erroneous entries,\n",
    "\n",
    "Subsection 4:\n",
    "\n",
    "You can do it in the following way:\n",
    "a) use `unique()` method to find all available values,\n",
    "b) use `loc` or `query` to find erroneous entries,\n",
    "c) The number of rows can be checked with the `shape` method."
